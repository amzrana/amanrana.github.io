### What is forced alignment ? Why should I know about it ?

- Forced alignment is the task of matching up text to when it is spoken in an audio.
- The 'forced' in 'forced alignment' refers to the fact that we provide the reference text ourselves and use the ASR model to get an alignment based on the assumption that this reference text is the real ground truth.
- Two inputs (a) audio, and (b) text associated with the audio.
